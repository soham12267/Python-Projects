fish disease detection - **Fish Disease Detection**

Fish disease detection involves the process of identifying and diagnosing diseases in fish. This is crucial for maintaining healthy aquaculture practices and preventing significant economic losses. 

**Common methods for fish disease detection include:**

* **Visual inspection:** Observing fish for external signs of disease, such as lesions, abnormal behavior, or color changes.
* **Laboratory analysis:** Conducting tests on water samples, fish tissues, or organs to identify pathogens or other abnormalities.
* **Image analysis:** Using computer vision techniques to analyze images of fish for signs of disease.

**Recent advancements in technology, such as:**

* **Machine learning:** Developing models to automatically detect diseases based on image analysis or other data.
* **IoT sensors:** Monitoring water quality parameters and fish behavior to identify potential health issues.

These advancements are revolutionizing fish disease detection, enabling early diagnosis and effective treatment, ultimately contributing to sustainable aquaculture.
